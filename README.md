# Simple-portfolio-website
I've designed and created this simple portfolio website as a personal project to enhance my skills in CSS styling and to get better at positioning elements on the page using flexbox. It serves as a platform for me to showcase some of my work and skills. Through this project, I aimed to create an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly website that effectively presents few on my projects in my portfolio. I thoroughly enjoyed the process of designing and refining the layout, and I continue to learn and improve my web development skills. Feel free to explore the different sections and get a glimpse of my work!
